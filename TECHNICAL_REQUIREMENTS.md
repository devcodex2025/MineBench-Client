# TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS (PRD / TASK FOR AI)

## Project name

**MineBench Client v1.0**

Cross-platform benchmarking and mining client with real Monero mining under the hood.

---

## 1. Project Goal

Redesign and rebuild the existing Electron-based mining client to:

* Support **Windows, Linux, macOS**
* Provide **real hardware benchmarking using Monero mining**
* Track **per-user performance and expected rewards**
* Deliver a **modern, high-end UI with 3D animations**
* Separate **Benchmark Mode** and **Mining Mode**
* Maintain transparency and user consent

---

## 2. Target Platforms

The client must be built and distributed for:

* Windows (x64)
* Linux (AppImage / deb / rpm)
* macOS (Intel + Apple Silicon)

Cross-platform build system is required.

---

## 3. Technology Stack (Recommended)

### Desktop Framework

---

## 7. Security & Transparency

* Clear explanation of mining usage
* No background mining without consent
* Visible start/stop controls
* Open-source core logic
* Signed binaries (Windows + macOS)

---

## 8. Configuration Management

* Auto-detect hardware

---

## 9. Auto Update System

* Delta updates
* Platform-specific installers
* Rollback on failure

---

## 10. Logging & Telemetry

Client logs:

* Mining start/stop
* Errors
* Performance stats

Telemetry (optional, anonymized):

* OS type
* CPU/GPU model
* Hashrate benchmarks

No personal data stored without consent.

---

## 11. Deliverables

AI must generate:

1. Cross-platform desktop application
2. Modular UI with reusable components
3. Mining controller (start/stop/status)
4. Benchmark mode logic
5. Build scripts for:

   * Windows
   * Linux
   * macOS
6. Documentation:

   * Architecture
   * Build instructions
   * Security notes

---

## 12. Non-Goals (Explicitly)

* No hidden mining
* No browser mining
* No external pool support
* No custodial wallets per user
* No payment IDs

---

## 13. Success Criteria

* App runs on all supported OS
* Stable mining sessions >24h
* Accurate benchmark results
* Smooth UI on mid-range hardware
* Clear user trust and transparency

---

## 14. Tokenized Reward System ($BMT)

### 14.1 Overview

The application uses a **tokenized reward model** where users receive rewards in the native project token **$BMT**, which represents mining contribution and performance.

Mining is performed in **Monero (XMR)**, but user-facing rewards are distributed in **$BMT**, based on internal accounting.

---

### 14.2 Reward Distribution Logic

All mined Monero is accounted internally and split as follows:

* **80%** — allocated to users
* **20%** — allocated to the application treasury (storage vault)

The user **never directly receives XMR** during normal operation.

---

### 14.3 Conversion Model (XMR → $BMT)

* User rewards are calculated based on:

  * Accepted shares
  * Hashrate contribution
  * Mining session duration
* The system calculates the **equivalent value** of mined XMR
* That value is **converted into $BMT** using:

  * Internal pricing logic OR
  * Oracle-based rate (implementation defined)

Important:

* $BMT is a **utility / accounting token**, not a mining pool payout token
* Conversion happens **off-chain or on-chain**, depending on implementation

---

### 14.4 User Reward Formula (Conceptual)

```text
total_xmr_mined = pool_reward
user_share = user_contribution / total_contribution

user_xmr_equivalent = total_xmr_mined * user_share * 0.80
app_xmr_share        = total_xmr_mined * 0.20

user_bmt_reward = convert(user_xmr_equivalent → BMT)
```

---

### 14.5 Treasury / Vault

* 20% of mined value is allocated to the **application treasury**
* Treasury purpose:

  * Infrastructure costs
  * Token liquidity
  * Long-term project sustainability
* Treasury address (reference):

```text
BMT Treasury:
He4qB3mLHzvD98C4HYEqiMjveVdkBGWeG4Knx4wXWC2G
```

*(Address is informational and must not be hardcoded into the client)*

---

### 14.6 Client Responsibilities

The desktop client must:

* Display:

  * Estimated mined XMR (virtual)
  * Converted $BMT rewards
  * User share percentage
* NOT:

  * Handle swaps directly
  * Interact with DEXes
  * Store private keys
* Only fetch:

  * Reward data from backend API

---

### 14.7 Backend Responsibilities (Assumed)

* Maintain authoritative mining statistics
* Calculate XMR-equivalent rewards
* Perform or simulate conversion to $BMT
* Credit user balances in $BMT
* Track treasury allocation separately

---

### 14.8 Transparency & User Communication

The UI must clearly explain:

* Mining is performed in Monero
* Rewards are paid in $BMT
* 80/20 reward split
* $BMT represents mining contribution, not direct XMR ownership

No misleading language allowed.

---

### 14.9 Explicit Non-Goals

* No direct XMR withdrawals from the client
* No private wallet generation inside the app
* No hidden fee mechanics beyond the 20% treasury allocation

---

## ⚠️ VERY IMPORTANT

The system must be designed as:

* **Performance-based reward accounting**
* **Tokenized incentive model**
* NOT as a custodial mining payout wallet
